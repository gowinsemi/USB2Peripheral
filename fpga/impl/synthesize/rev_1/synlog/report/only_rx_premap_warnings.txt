@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MO129 :"e:\ip_project\usb\usb2iis\test_0525\usb2iis\only_rx\src\usb_ini.vhd":118:11:118:18|Sequential instance u_usb_1p1.u_usb_for_uart.usb_init_inst.PHY_OPMODE[1] is reduced to a combinational gate by constant propagation.
@W: MT529 :"e:\ip_project\usb\usb2iis\test_0525\usb2iis\only_rx\src\par2iis_ver2.v":152:0:152:5|Found inferred clock _~usb_1p1_USB_TOP__2235_10182_256_10s_10s|PHY_CLKOUT_inferred_clock which controls 427 sequential elements including u_usb_1p1.serial2iis_ver1.par2iis.cnt_en. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
